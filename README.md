**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

# **Product Name:** Container Image Vulnerability Scanner

## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Background**
Organizations increasingly rely on containerized applications, but container images often include outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities. A security product is needed to scan these images, detect vulnerabilities, and provide actionable insights to users.

### **1.2 Objective**
Develop a tool that scans container images for vulnerabilities and provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing security issues effectively.

## **2. User Stories**
### **2.1 Primary Users**
- DevOps Engineers
- Security Analysts
- System Administrators

### **2.2 User Needs**
- As a **user**, I need to **view all container images** in my repository to understand which ones have vulnerabilities.
- As a **user**, I need to **see vulnerability details** per image, including severity levels.
- As a **user**, I need to **filter/sort images** based on vulnerability severity, age, or repository.
- As a **user**, I need **remediation recommendations** for critical/high vulnerabilities.
- As a **user**, I need to **export reports** for compliance and auditing.

## **3. Functional Requirements**
### **3.1 Image Scanning & Vulnerability Detection**
- Scan all container images for vulnerabilities.
- Identify affected dependencies within the image.
- Provide real-time vulnerability updates.

### **3.2 Dashboard & User Interface**
- Display a **list of container images** with vulnerability summaries.
- Show detailed **vulnerability reports** with severity categorization (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Allow users to **filter** and **search** vulnerabilities by severity, image name, date, etc.
- Provide a **remediation plan** for identified vulnerabilities.
- Display a **historical trend of vulnerabilities** for tracking security progress.

### **3.3 Notifications & Alerts**
- Notify users when critical/high vulnerabilities are detected.
- Allow email/slack integrations for real-time alerts.

### **3.4 Reporting & Compliance**
- Generate **downloadable reports** (PDF, CSV) with scan results.
- Provide **audit logs** for compliance tracking.

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Scalability**: Must handle thousands of container images efficiently.
- **Performance**: Scans should complete in a reasonable time.
- **Security**: Ensure data protection and access control.
- **Usability**: Simple, intuitive UI with effective visualizations.

**Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Container Image Vulnerability Scanner**

## **1. Dashboard View**
- Displays a summary of all container images scanned.
- Columns: Image Name, Last Scan Date, Critical Issues, High Issues, Medium Issues, Low Issues.
- Status indicators: Green (No issues), Yellow (Medium/Low issues), Red (Critical/High issues).
- Filter & Search options at the top.
- Button for rescanning images.

## **2. Image Details Page**
- Shows detailed vulnerability findings for a selected container image.
- Sections:
  - Image metadata (Name, Repository, Last Scan Date).
  - List of vulnerabilities categorized by severity.
  - Clickable vulnerabilities leading to details (CVE ID, Description, Affected Component, Fix Available?).
  - Suggested fixes & remediation steps.

## **3. Filtering & Sorting Options**
- Filter by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Filter by date of last scan.
- Sort by number of vulnerabilities, repository, scan date.
- Checkbox for showing only images with fixable vulnerabilities.

## **4. Remediation View**
- Displays a list of all fixable vulnerabilities.
- Suggests upgrading specific dependencies or using a newer base image.
- One-click option to generate a remediation plan.

## **5. Reporting & Export Section**
- Option to download reports in CSV or PDF.
- Compliance reports with vulnerability history.
- Audit logs of all scans and remediation actions taken.

### **Next Steps:**
- Get feedback on wireframes.
- Refine UI/UX based on user requirements.
- Proceed with interactive prototyping and implementation.
